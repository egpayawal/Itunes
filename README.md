### Dependencies

Most common libraries:

* [Realm] - One of the best alternative to SQLite and Core Data, and much faster than an ORM, and often faster than raw SQLite.
* [Retrofit 2.0] - An open source library which simplifies HTTP communication by turning remote APIs into declarative, type-safe interfaces. It makes it relatively easy to retrieve and upload JSON (or other structured data) via a REST based webservice. It automatically serializes the JSON response using a POJO which must be defined in advanced for the JSON Structure.
* [DaggerHilt 2.0] - Dependency injection framework, provides a simple way to obtain references to shared instances.
* [RxJava 2.0] - Reactive programming provides a clean, efficient way of processing and reacting to streams of real-time data, including data with dynamic values.
* [Glide] - Glide is a fast and efficient open source media management and image loading framework for Android that wraps media decoding, memory and disk caching, and resource pooling into a simple and easy to use interface.
